                   and using several web-based tools to facilitate access
                   to and management of images from inside and outside of
                   our department. Having recently eliminated film in
                   ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
                   resonance imaging (MRI), a simple method was required
                   to access imaging from computers already existing
                   throughout the hospital. The success of the World Wide
                   Web (WWW), the familiarity of endusers with web
                   browsers, and the relative ease of developing user
                   interfaces virtually dictated that such an approach be
                   pursued in our case. The resulting web-based tools
                   allow validated users to search our Digital Imaging and
                   Communications in Medicine (DICOM)-compliant archive
                   servers for specific exams; to download image data from
                   a remote site; to request the retrieval of data from
                   long-term storage; to view images, and to perform
                   certain DICOM routing operations. The existing
                   infrastructure of the internet has allowed us to
                   develop a low-cost system capable of being used for
                   teleradiology. Since low-level, machine-specific
                   interface programming was avoided, these tools were
                   developed rapidly and are easily adapted. The
                   familiarity of browser-based interfaces has facilitated
                   user acceptance, and the benefit of platform
                   independence minimizes software portability concerns.},

                   bioinformatics, from in-the-small to in-the-large.
                   Adopting a large-scale perspective is a way to manage
                   the problems endemic to the world of the
                   small-constellations of incompatible tools for which
                   the effort required to assemble an integrated system
                   exceeds the perceived benefit of the integration. Where
                   bioinformatics in-the-small is about data and tools,
                   bioinformatics in-the-large is about metadata and
                   dependencies. Dependencies represent the complexities
                   of large-scale integration, including the requirements
                   and assumptions governing the composition of tools. The
                   popular make utility is a very effective system for
                   defining and maintaining simple dependencies, and it
                   offers a number of insights about the essence of
                   bioinformatics in-the-large. Keeping an in-the-large
                   perspective has been very useful to us in large
                   bioinformatics projects. We give two fairly different
                   examples, and extract lessons from them showing how it
                   has helped. These examples both suggest the benefit of
                   explicitly defining and managing knowledge flows and
                   knowledge maps (which represent metadata regarding
                   types, flows, and dependencies), and also suggest
                   approaches for developing bioinformatics database
                   systems. Generally, we argue that large-scale
                   engineering principles can be successfully adapted from
                   disciplines such as software engineering and data
                   management, and that having an in-the-large perspective
                   will be a key advantage in the next phase of
                   bioinformatics development.},

  abstract       = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition {(PMD)}, a
                   new framework for computing a {rank-K} approximation
                   for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as , where
                   dk, uk, and vk minimize the squared Frobenius norm of
                   X, subject to penalties on uk and vk. This results in a
                   regularized version of the singular value
                   decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of
                   L1-penalties on uk and vk, which yields a decomposition
                   of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the {PMD}
                   is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a
                   method for sparse principal components results. In
                   fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the
                   {“SCoTLASS”} proposal {(Jolliffe} and others 2003)
                   for obtaining sparse principal components. This method
                   is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression
                   data set. We also establish connections between the
                   {SCoTLASS} method for sparse principal component
                   analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In
                   addition, we show that when the {PMD} is applied to a
                   cross-products matrix, it results in a method for
                   penalized canonical correlation analysis {(CCA).} We
                   apply this penalized {CCA} method to simulated data and
                   to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and
                   {DNA} copy number measurements on the same set of
                   samples.},

                   of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
                   {(LSST)} will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters
                   and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6

                   deg{\\textasciicircum}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing
                   will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures
                   in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total
                   point-source depth of r{\\textasciitilde}27.5. The
                   {LSST} Science Book describes the basic parameters of
                   the {LSST} hardware, software, and observing plans. The
                   book discusses educational and outreach opportunities,
                   then goes on to describe a broad range of science that
                   {LSST} will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer
                   Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and
                   nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk
                   and halo and other objects in the Local Volume,
                   transient and variable objects both at low and high
                   redshift, and the properties of normal and active
                   galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to
                   far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of
                   supernovae to z{\\textasciitilde}1, strong and weak
                   lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and
                   baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may
                   be combined to constrain cosmological models and the
                   physics of dark energy.},

                   identified two distinct networks with dissociable
                   resting state connectivity patterns. This study, in
                   patients with heterogeneous damage to these networks,
                   demonstrates network independence through a double
                   dissociation of lesion location on two different
                   measures of network integrity: functional correlations
                   among network nodes and within-node graph theory
                   network properties. The degree of network damage
                   correlates with a decrease in functional connectivity
                   within that network while sparing the nonlesioned
                   network. Graph theory properties of intact nodes within
                   the damaged network show evidence of dysfunction
                   compared with the undamaged network. The effect of
                   anatomical damage thus extends beyond the lesioned
                   area, but remains within the bounds of the existing
                   network connections. Together this evidence suggests
                   that networks defined by their role in cognitive
                   control processes exhibit independence in resting data.},

  abstract       = {Variable x-ray and gamma-ray emission is
                   characteristic of the most extreme physical processes
                   in the universe. We present multiwavelength
                   observations of a unique gamma-ray selected transient,
                   detected by the Swift satellite and accompanied by
                   bright emission across the electromagnetic spectrum,
                   and whose properties are unlike any previously observed
                   source. We pinpoint the event to the center of a small,
                   star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. Its
                   high-energy emission has lasted much longer than any
                   gamma-ray burst, while its peak luminosity was
                   approximately 100 times higher than bright active
                   galactic nuclei. The association of the outburst with
                   the center of its host galaxy suggests that this
                   phenomenon has its origin in a rare mechanism involving
                   the massive black hole in the nucleus of that galaxy.},

                   luminous emission, the vast majority of MBHs are
                   considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too
                   near a MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces,
                   leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). While
                   the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially
                   displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor

                   the observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto
                   a central MBH of mass approximately 10(6) to 10(7)
                   solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly
                   relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum
                   characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton
                   processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw
